# Defensive tooling

* This course is intended to be mostly vendor neutral
* Covers high level topics that would transfer to all or most vendors
+ Some labs will use specifics tools but only where there are free or open source versions .
+ Enterprise security tools = $$$


## Firewall

- Filter network traffic entering or exiting a network or computer
- physical or virtual, network or host based.
- Blocks unwanted or unsafe traffic
- Check Source and Destination IP Address, Port and Protocol.


## ACL (access control list) tables

Rule   Action(permit/deny)	 Protocol	Src IP(s)	Src Port Dest IP(s) Dest Port(s)

1	   Permit				 TCP    	<ip>/24		any		 Any  		80
2	   permit 				 TCP    	<ip>/24  	any		 any		443
3	   permit				 UDP		<ip>/24		any	     any		80
4 	   permit				 UDP		<ip>/24 	any		 any		443
5
6	   Deny					 Any(IP)	Any			any		 any		any

Note ACLs work based on heirachy

## Traditional vs Next Gen(NG)

- traditional firewals only filters on IPs, ports, and protocols.
- the above examples are for traditional firewalss
- newer firewalls called Next Gen or (NG) filter on many more factors.
- User identity and behaviours, threat intelligence, decryption, packet inspection, content filtering.
