# Vulnerability

* A weakness or misconfiguration in software, hardware, process, physical design that can cause unintended behavior.

* this can include:

  - Softwaer bugs (buffer overflow, command injection, information disclosure)
  - Configuration issues (default credentials)
  - Design flaws (using weak cryptography)
  - Gaps in processes (Changin of guards out of synch)

# Exploit

* Is a method in which a vulnerability is taken advantage of to achieve the un-intended behaviour.

* This include :

  - Software attacks (crafting a specific payload)
  - Plans that take advantage of gaps in processes
  - Targeting systems with default credentials.


# Chain of events

* Attackers, security researchers and vendors are all hunting for vulnerabilities.
* Frequently vendors are notified ahead of time to allow them to patch.
* when a vulnerability is disclosed and or exploited before a vendor knows about it this is referred to as a zero-day(0-day).
* The existence of a vulnerability doesn't mean there is an exploit.
* Some exploits aer made public as Proof of Concepts (P.O.C)

# Examples of unintended behaviours

* remote code execution: ability to run abitrary code on a target system.
* priviledge excalation: gaining higher level permission.
* information disclosure: leaking information that is either harmful or could aid an attacker .
* unauthorized data access: gaining access to files or data without proper authorization(file traversal)
* denial of service: disrupting the availability of a system.
* Atuthentication bypass: circumventing logins or access controls.
* Business logic bypass: flaws in how an application or process works (stacking coupon codes)
