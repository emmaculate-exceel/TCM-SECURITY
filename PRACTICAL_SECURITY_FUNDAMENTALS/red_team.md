# Red Team

+ Red team are the offensive side of cybersecurity
+ They are responsible for testing systems usually by simulating real world attacks
+ They Improves security by identifing weaknesses before the bad guys do .
+ They also help the blue team experience world the real world attack will be or look like.

 ## Core responsibilities

 + Performs penetrations tests, vulnerability scan and other adversarial emulation.
 + mimic tools and techniques used by adversaries .
 + Develop tools and exploits.
 + Strictly follow scope, regulations and laws.
 + report writing and documentations
 + perform client debriefs
 + Many disciplines for testing all different products.

## What is a Penetration Test

 + Varies based on target (how much information to give to testers)

+ White box (all internal details needed by a hacker), grey box (in this case the tester is given an initial foothold to save some time but not all the details), black box(no details is given to the tester here just like the real world scenerio where they have to figure everything out just like an actual hacker to try to do).
 
 + Credentiated/Non-Credentiated(amount of information/access given or credentials like password and other that might be given) internal/external (also might be an internal or an external kind of test where we can put the tester inside the network to make it looks like they've already breached it or an external where they may have to walk their way in all the way the way from the outside to the inside like a normal hacker would do)

 + Overt (How many people in the organization are going to be aware of the test of the test being performed) Vs Covert (No one knows if anything is going to happen at all)

- Authorized security test on a system, network, application to identify vulnerabilites.
- Tests can vary depending on clients needs and wants.
- Usually follow known guidelines, methodologies and frameworks for testing .
- Frequently performed by external companies or contractors.
- End goal is to improve overall security.

## phases of penetration test

- planning and scopping (what is to be tested)
- Recon and OSINT (information gathering)
- scanning and Vulnerabilities Identification (looking for weaknesses)
- Exploitation (taking advantages of those weaknesses and see can used)
- Post Exploitation (repeat 2-5 as needed) (this is where they try to use the weaknesses)
- cleaning up (clear tracks and return systems back to the way they originally were)
- Reporting and debriefing (write report and explain to client what was found and how they can be fixed)

## penetration test vs red team

- penetration testers are a part of the red team.
- Red team is a different term.
- penetration test are usually less covert and not concerned with evasion
- red team is usually more covert and aims to emulate a specific adversaries or threat.
- uses more complex tactics such as custom tooling or exploits and social engineering.


## Who's performing the test

- penetration tester (Ethical hacker)
- Have in-depth knowledge of the systems and how it works they test common vulnerabilities and exploits.
- keep up to date with new tools, techniques , exploits , vulnerabilities and technologies.
- Write documentations and reports
- Communicate with technical and non-technical folks


## Exploit/Malware developer

- performs security research to uncover novel vulnerabilities.
- Write exploits to target vulnerabilities and systems.
- Write custom red team tooling
- Write malware for targeted engagements.


## Social Engineer

- Specializes in various forms of social engineering
- Conduct phishing campaigns
- Performs targeted social engineering campaigns
- Perform user education and training.

## OSINT Researcher or Investigator

- OSINT = Open Source Intelligence.
- performs research and investigations on individuals and companies.
- Includes looking through social media, forums, news even the darkweb.
- linking accounts together or attributing annonymous accounts.
- Gathering passwords or other details from breaches.

## Common pentesting Domains

- Network
- Webapp
- Mobile
- Applications
- IoT / Hardware
- Industrial Control Systems (ICS)
- Cloud
- AI
- Physical/Building
