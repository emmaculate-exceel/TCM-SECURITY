# Phone Etiquette
---

The term “phone etiquette” is used to describe a code of conduct
for making and receiving phone calls.
Rules such as speaking clearly, using appropriate greetings and
farewells, and being respectful and considerate of the person on the
other end of the line apply to both personal and professional

##communications.

1. Answer the phone promptly and politely, using a greeting such as “Hello” or
“Good Morning/afternoon.”
2. Identify yourself and your company, if applicable.
3. Speak clearly and distinctly, using a pleasant tone of voice.
4. Listen attentively to the person on the other end of the line and give them your
full attention.
5. Use proper language and avoid using slang or inappropriate language.
6. Avoid interrupting the person you are speaking with, and allow them to finish
their thoughts before speaking.

## Actionable Task

A smile is more about a mindset.
It's the first thing a customer/user/person sees, and it shows that you and/or the business are
committed to providing a good product or service. It affects everything we do, every deal we
make, and how we deal with every person we interact with.
When we smile, the style of our voice changes. Most times, the person on the other end of the
phone call will pick up on this and help set the tone for the remainder of the conversation.

Studies have shown that smiling will help improve your mood, handle stress, and improve
interactions with individuals.
Now try this for yourself.
Use your phone to record a greeting where you are smiling and one where you are not
smiling. Notice the difference.

Unlock the Secret

###LISTEN:
The most important aspect of empathy is listening. Be clear on what this person is
communicating to you. Make a note of the words used that indicate and emotional
attachment to the situation at hand.
UNDERSTAND:
When you practice active listening and gather keywords you can begin to understand how
this person is feeling. Are they angry, frustrated, or happy?

###REACT:
Once you’ve understood the situation, you can provide more thoughtful and directed
responses or direct the conversation to a neutral point by utilizing the keywords and
information you previously learned.

###REASSURE:
Provide confidence by reassuring the person that you will work together to find a successful
solution or outcome to the situation or topic.

thoughts or explain their issues before you begin speaking.
Please note any questions or thoughts you may have while they are speaking and wait to
address them until they are finished talking.

is saying.
