# Email Etiquette

## PRO TIP: GET TO THE POINT

Getting to the point allows the recipient to quickly understand the message’s intent.

Avoid including information and content that is unrelated to the overall message or topic.

Additionally, getting to the point in an email or conversation demonstrates that you value the other person’s time, which can often elicit a better response.

 

 

 

## Professional Etiquette


### CONCISE:

Stick to the main point of the conversation or topic and avoid unnecessary details or information that are not relevant.

 

### CLARITY:

Avoid jargon or slang that might not be understood by all parties involved. Treat conversations and emails as though everyone has a basic understanding of the topic unless you have “read the room” and you have a general understanding of your audience.

 

 

 

### POLITE:

Use appropriate language and always say “please” and “thank you.” When it comes to the world of IT, “please” and “thank you” will go a long way.

### FOOTPRINT:

It goes without saying, but it must be mentioned regardless. From your digital footprint to your physical footprint, your actions are often monitored or logged. Staying professional at all times will help you avoid conflict or issues down the road.

 

 

Digital Communication Tips

 

·      A professional email should have a subject line that accurately reflects the email’s content.


·     The email’s body should be well-written and free of spelling and grammar mistakes.


·     It should also be well-organized and simple to read, which paragraphs and bullet points to break up long sections of text.


·     Even if the content of the email is critical or negative, a professional email should be respectful and polite.


·     Avoid using slang, emoji, or other informal language, and instead use a formal greeting and closing.

It is essential to keep these tips in mind when conversing over digital forms of communication, like Slack, Discord, or other social media.

 

Reminder

 

Treat every piece of text you write as if it will be kept and stored somewhere forever, and someone might end up seeing what you wrote at some point in time.

Most often than not, everything you do in the workplace is logged, from the emails you send or receive, the websites you visit, or programs you use on the computer.

By maintaining professional standards, you can often avoid uncomfortable situations.

Writing Emails

Email Example #1:

 

Subject Line: Endpoint Protection Project Status

Hello [Name],

I wanted to provide an update on the progress of the endpoint protection project that we are currently working on.

As you know, our goal is to roll out this project as smoothly as possible, with minimal disruption to our business operations. However, I wanted to let you know that we will be experiencing some interruptions to our services on 01/22/23 from 9pm - 1:00am as we implement certain components of this project.

In particular, we will need to restart some critical servers as part of the process, which may result in temporary interruptions to certain services that will primarily affect our offsite Accounting and Human Resources teams.

We are doing everything in our power to minimize the duration of these interruptions and will provide updates to affected teams as needed. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and assure you that we are working diligently to get the project completed as efficiently as possible.

If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for your understanding and support during this process.

Best regards,

[Your Name]

 

Email Example #2:


Subject Line: Endpoint Protection Project Status

Hello [Name],

I wanted to provide an update on the progress of the endpoint protection project that we are currently working on.

As you know, the project has come to a point where we will be experiencing interruptions due to the DC(HYDRA-DC) needing additional .NET upgrades and Windows updates that will require multiple reboots of this machine.

As we initially discussed we had the opportunity to create a failover solution, but management has decided against spending additional funds to purchase the extra hardware that we would require. Unfortunately, this is going to cause unwanted downtime, so we will be coming into the office at 9pm to complete the upgrades while there are less staff utilizing these services. We are anticipating that this should only take about 30 minutes but we extended the downtime window in case anything unexpected happens.

If you can think of any additional services or users that may be impacted by this, please let me know. Otherwise we will plan to continue moving forward with this project.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
