# Resume Writing tips

___

### Tip 1 - Shorter is better

if you are new to the industry or just out of college, your resume
should be one page.

if you are more senior, 2 page is acceptable.

Never go beyond 2 pages unless you are in academia or in nsome form of research capacity.

### Tip 2 pass the eye test


Hiring managers often have 15-30 seconds to review your resume. Make sure you are leading with the most important, eye-catching items first. This includes putting relevant education and certifications near the top of your resume. Do not make these difficult to find or you risk failing the eye test.

### Tip 3 keep your Header Concise.

Your resume header should include your name , email, phone and address (if the job is local or remote).

you may include up to two links, such as a linkedIn profile and Github. Do not add more than 2 links

At most , your header should take up 2 lines and very little space on your resume.


### Tip 4 Use a Seperate, professional Email Address

it is highl recommeded to use a seperate email address when job hunting.
this email address should be professional (e.g do not have an email address of non acceptable words or pattern) any combination of your firstname and lastname is fine

We strongly recommend proton mail or Gmail


### Tip 5 Keep your education short


Utilize one line per degree. if you have a bachelor's degree, it is not necessary to put your high school diploma on your resume. The same goes for your associates (if you have a bachelor's ) if it is older or not relevant to the field.

if you have a bachelor's from an unrelated field, it is fine to leave it on your resume.
if you have a masters or phD, it is fine to leave your bachelor's on your resume.

do not put your college Courses on your resume. it takes up too much space.
Do not put your papers and/or thesis on your resume unless it is relevant to the job you are applying for .
Do not put your GPA on your resume if it is above a 3.0 and leave it off otherwise .

### Tip 6 Certifications

Lead with your best certifications.

Adapt the order on the certifications on your resume to the job you are applying for. if the job requests a specific certifications, list those first.

### Tip 7 experience

Your most recent experience should have the most bullet points (approximately 4-6) Bullet poinst should taper off the older jobs.

Limit your job history to three jobs, unless the jobs are relevant to your current position. As an example, if you workd help desk four jobs ago and are now applying to a manager position, it is not relevant. if you were a manager four jobs ago and applying to a senior manager position, it may be relevant.

Utilize numbers and metrics in your bullet points. for example, if you worked help desk,
provided support for 2,000 end users with a ticket response and time of 8 minutes and 99% satisfactory rate" looks good and better than "Provided support for end users "

### Tip 8 Attention to details is key

Ensure that your grammar is correct, including punctuation and capitalization.

if you use a period after an experience bullet point, then use a period for all experience bullet points and vice versa. Mixing and matching shows poor attention to details as does poor grammar


### Tip 9 Extracurricular Stand Out

If you have ever built a home lab, writte a blog, attended a conference, made a youtube video, participated in a CTF, given a conference talk, volunteered, etc use this on your resume.

Extracurricular show passion for the field and help you stand out amongst candidates with similar qualifications.
