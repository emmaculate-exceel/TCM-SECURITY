* Defines security goals and objectives risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity, and the law.

### Asset Security

* secures digital and physical assets .
* it's also related to the storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction of data

### Security Architecture and Engineering

* Optimizes data security by ensuring effective tools, systems and processes are in place.


### Communication and Network Security

* Manages and secure physical networks and wireless communications.

### Identity and access management

* Keeps data secure by ensuring that users follow established policiesto control and manage physical assets, like office spaces, and logical assets, such as networks and applications.

### Security assessement and testing

* Conducting security control testing, collecting and analyzing data, and conducting, security audits to monitor for risks, threat and vulnerabilities.

### Security Operations

* Conducting investigations and implementing preventive measures.

### Software development Securities

* Uses secure coding practices, which are a set of recommended guidelines that are used to create secure applications and services .






## Determine the Type of attack

Determine the type of attack
Previously, you learned about the eight Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) security domains. The domains can help you better understand how a security analyst's job duties can be organized into categories. Additionally, the domains can help establish an understanding of how to manage risk. In this reading, you will learn about additional methods of attack. You’ll also be able to recognize the types of risk these attacks present.

Graphic of the eight icons that represent the CISSP security domains.
Attack types
Password attack
A password attack is an attempt to access password-secured devices, systems, networks, or data. Some forms of password attacks that you’ll learn about later in the certificate program are:  

Brute force

Rainbow table

Password attacks fall under the communication and network security domain. 

Social engineering attack
Social engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables. Some forms of social engineering attacks that you will continue to learn about throughout the program are: 

Phishing

Smishing

Vishing

Spear phishing

Whaling

Social media phishing

Business Email Compromise (BEC)

Watering hole attack

USB (Universal Serial Bus) baiting

Physical social engineering 

Social engineering attacks are related to the security and risk management domain.

Physical attack
A physical attack is a security incident that affects not only digital but also physical environments where the incident is deployed. Some forms of physical attacks are:

Malicious USB cable

Malicious flash drive

Card cloning and skimming

Physical attacks fall under the asset security domain. 

Adversarial artificial intelligence
Adversarial artificial intelligence is a technique that manipulates 
artificial intelligence and machine learning
 technology to conduct attacks more efficiently. Adversarial artificial intelligence falls under both the communication and network security and the identity and access management domains.

Supply-chain attack
A supply-chain attack targets systems, applications, hardware, and/or software to locate a vulnerability where malware can be deployed. Because every item sold undergoes a process that involves third parties, this means that the security breach can occur at any point in the supply chain. These attacks are costly because they can affect multiple organizations and the individuals who work for them. Supply-chain attacks can fall under several domains, including but not limited to the security and risk management, security architecture and engineering, and security operations domains.

Cryptographic attack
A cryptographic attack affects secure forms of communication between a sender and intended recipient. Some forms of cryptographic attacks are: 

Birthday

Collision

Downgrade

Cryptographic attacks fall under the communication and network security domain. 

Key takeaways
The eight CISSP security domains can help an organization and its security team fortify against and prepare for a data breach. Data breaches range from simple to complex and fall under one or more domains. Note that the methods of attack discussed are only a few of many. These and other types of attacks will be discussed throughout the certificate program.

Understand attackers
Previously, you were introduced to the concept of threat actors. As a reminder, a threat actor is any person or group who presents a security risk. In this reading, you’ll learn about different types of threat actors. You will also learn about their motivations, intentions, and how they’ve influenced the security industry.

Threat actor types
Advanced persistent threats
Advanced persistent threats (APTs) have significant expertise accessing an organization's network without authorization. APTs tend to research their targets (e.g., large corporations or government entities)  in advance and can remain undetected for an extended period of time. Their intentions and motivations can include:

Damaging critical infrastructure, such as the power grid and natural resources

Gaining access to intellectual property, such as trade secrets or patents

Insider threats
Insider threats abuse their authorized access to obtain data that may harm an organization. Their intentions and motivations can include: 

Sabotage

Corruption

Espionage

Unauthorized data access or leaks 

Hacktivists
Hacktivists are threat actors that are driven by a political agenda. They abuse digital technology to accomplish their goals, which may include: 

Demonstrations

Propaganda

Social change campaigns

Fame

Hacker types
Six hackers on computers.
A hacker is any person who uses computers to gain access to computer systems, networks, or data. They can be beginner or advanced technology professionals who use their skills for a variety of reasons. There are three main categories of hackers:

Authorized hackers are also called ethical hackers. They follow a code of ethics and adhere to the law to conduct organizational risk evaluations. They are motivated to safeguard people and organizations from malicious threat actors.

Semi-authorized hackers are considered researchers. They search for vulnerabilities but don’t take advantage of the vulnerabilities they find.

Unauthorized hackers are also called unethical hackers. They are malicious threat actors who do not follow or respect the law. Their goal is to collect and sell confidential data for financial gain. 

Note: There are multiple hacker types that fall into one or more of these three categories.

New and unskilled threat actors have various goals, including: 

To learn and enhance their hacking skills

To seek revenge

To exploit security weaknesses by using existing malware, programming scripts, and other tactics 

Other types of hackers are not motivated by any particular agenda other than completing the job they were contracted to do. These types of hackers can be considered unethical or ethical hackers. They have been known to work on both illegal and legal tasks for pay.

There are also hackers who consider themselves vigilantes. Their main goal is to protect the world from unethical hackers.

Key takeaways
Threat actors are defined by their malicious intent and hackers are defined by their technical skills and motivations. Understanding their motivations and intentions will help you be better prepared to protect your organization and the people it serves from malicious attacks carried out by some of these individuals and groups.
