# Log

 * Log is a record of events that occur within an organization's system or systems.


A log is a record of events that occur within an organization's systems. Examples of security-related logs include records of employees signing into their computers or accessing web-based services. Logs help security professionals identify vulnerabilities and potential security breaches.

The first tools we'll discuss are security information and event management tools, or SIEM tools. A SIEM tool is an application that collects and analyzes log data to monitor critical activities in an organization. The acronym S-I-E-M may be pronounced as 'sim' or 'seem', but we'll use 'sim' throughout this program. SIEM tools collect real-time, or instant, information, and allow security analysts to identify potential breaches as they happen.


Imagine having to read pages and pages of logs to determine if there are any security threats. Depending on the amount of data, it could take hours or days. SIEM tools reduce the amount of data an analyst must review by providing alerts for specific types of risks and threats. Next, let's go over examples of commonly used SIEM tools: Splunk and Chronicle.


Splunk is a data analysis platform, and Splunk Enterprise provides SIEM solutions. Splunk Enterprise is a self-hosted tool used to retain, analyze, and search an organization's log data.

Another SIEM tool is Google's Chronicle. Chronicle is a cloud-native SIEM tool that stores security data for search and analysis. Cloud-native means that Chronicle allows for fast delivery of new features.


Both of these SIEM tools, and SIEMs in general, collect data from multiple places, then analyze and filter that data to allow security teams to prevent and quickly react to potential security threats.


As a security analyst, you may find yourself using SIEM tools to analyze filtered events and patterns, perform incident analysis, or proactively search for threats. Depending on your organization's SIEM setup and risk focus, the tools and how they function may differ, but ultimately, they are all used to mitigate risk.

Other key tools that you will use in your role as a security analyst, and that you'll have hands-on opportunities to use later in the program, are playbooks and network protocol analyzers.


A playbook is a manual that provides details about any operational action, such as how to respond to an incident. Playbooks, which vary from one organization to the next, guide analysts in how to handle a security incident before, during, and after it has occurred. Playbooks can pertain to security or compliance reviews, access management, and many other organizational tasks that require a documented process from beginning to end.


Another tool you may use as a security analyst is a network protocol analyzer, also called packet sniffer. A packet sniffer is a tool designed to capture and analyze data traffic within a network. Common network protocol analyzers include tcpdump and Wireshark.
