* Nist Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)

  - A voluntary framework that consist of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk.

Welcome back. Before we get started, let's quickly review the purpose of frameworks. Organizations use frameworks as a starting point to develop plans that mitigate risks, threats, and vulnerabilities to sensitive data and assets. Fortunately, there are organizations worldwide that create frameworks security professionals can use to develop those plans.

In this video, we'll discuss two of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST's frameworks that can support ongoing security efforts for all types of organizations, including for profit and nonprofit businesses, as well as government agencies. While NIST is a US based organization, the guidance it provides can help analysts all over the world understand how to implement essential cybersecurity practices. One NIST framework that we'll discuss throughout the program is the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, or CSF.

The CSF is a voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk. This framework is widely respected and essential for maintaining security regardless of the organization you work for. The CSF consists of five important core functions, identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover, which we'll discuss in detail in a future video. For now, we'll focus on how the CSF benefits organizations and how it can be used to protect against threats, risks, and vulnerabilities by providing a workplace example.

Imagine that one morning you receive a high-risk notification that a workstation has been compromised. You identify the workstation, and discover that there's an unknown device plugged into it. You block the unknown device remotely to stop any potential threat and protect the organization. Then you remove the infected workstation to prevent the spread of the damage and use tools to detect any additional threat actor behavior and identify the unknown device. You respond by investigating the incident to determine who used the unknown device, how the threat occurred, what was affected, and where the attack originated.

In this case, you discover that an employee was charging their infected phone using a USB port on their work laptop. Finally, you do your best to recover any files or data that were affected and correct any damage the threat caused to the workstation itself.

As demonstrated by the previous example, the core functions of the NIST CSF provide specific guidance and direction for security professionals. This framework is used to develop plans to handle an incident appropriately and quickly to lower risk, protect an organization against a threat, and mitigate any potential vulnerabilities. The NIST CSF also expands into the protection of the United States federal government with NIST special publication, or SP 800-53. It provides a unified framework for protecting the security of information systems within the federal government, including the systems provided by private companies for federal government use.

The security controls provided by this framework are used to maintain the CIA triad for those systems used by the government. Isn't it amazing how all of these frameworks and controls work together. We've discussed some really important security topics in this video that will be very useful for you as you continue your security journey. Because they're core elements of the security profession, the NIST CSF is a useful framework that most security professionals are familiar with, and having an understanding of the NIST, SP 800-53 is crucial if you have an interest in working for the US federal government. Coming up, we'll continue to explore the five NIST CSF functions and how organizations use them to protect assets and data.

Hello again! I'm excited you're here. We have so much to discuss. Previously, we covered the uses and benefits of the NIST CSF. In this video, we'll focus specifically on the five core functions of the NIST CSF framework. Let's get started.

NIST CSF focuses on five core functions: identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover. These core functions help organizations manage cybersecurity risks, implement risk management strategies, and learn from previous mistakes. Basically, when it comes to security operations, NIST CSF functions are key for making sure an organization is protected against potential threats, risks, and vulnerabilities. So let's take a little time to explore how each function can be used to improve an organization's security.
Play video starting at :1:3 and follow transcript1:03
The first core function is identify, which is related to the management of cybersecurity risk and its effect on an organization's people and assets. For example, as a security analyst, you may be asked to monitor systems and devices in your organization's internal network to identify potential security issues
Play video starting at :1:26 and follow transcript1:26
The second core function is protect, which is the strategy used to protect an organization through the implementation of policies, procedures, training, and tools that help mitigate cybersecurity threats.
Play video starting at :1:41 and follow transcript1:41
For example, as a security analyst, you and your team might encounter new and unfamiliar threats and attacks. For this reason, studying historical data and making improvements to policies and procedures is essential.
Play video starting at :1:57 and follow transcript1:57
The third core function is detect, which means identifying potential security incidents and improving monitoring capabilities to increase the speed and efficiency of detections. For example, as an analyst, you might be asked to review a new security tool's setup to make sure it's flagging low, medium, or high risk, and then alerting the security team about any potential threats or incidents. The fourth function is respond, which means making sure that the proper procedures are used to contain, neutralize, and analyze security incidents, and implement improvements to the security process.
Play video starting at :2:41 and follow transcript2:41
As an analyst, you could be working with a team to collect and organize data to document an incident and suggest improvements to processes to prevent the incident from happening again.
Play video starting at :2:54 and follow transcript2:54
The fifth core function is recover, which is the process of returning affected systems back to normal operation.
Play video starting at :3:3 and follow transcript3:03
For example, as an entry-level security analyst, you might work with your security team to restore systems, data, and assets, such as financial or legal files, that have been affected by an incident like a breach.

We've covered a lot of information in this video. Hopefully, it helped you understand the value of learning about the NIST CSF and its five core functions.

From proactive to reactive measures, all five functions are essential for making sure that an organization has effective security strategies in place.

Security incidents are going to happen, but an organization must have the ability to quickly recover from any damage caused by an incident to minimize their level of risk.

Coming up, we'll discuss security principles that work hand-in-hand with NIST frameworks and the CIA triad to help protect critical data and assets.
